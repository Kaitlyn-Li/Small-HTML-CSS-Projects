# My Small (but awesome) Projects

This repo contains a list of small features that I built using HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. By building these small projects, it enables me to explore to the deeper end of CSS where I can get play with some functionalities that CSS provides that I don't get to use very often. 

## How It's Made: 

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS (mainly), JavaScript

In these projects I tend to use a lot of CSS properties that I do not get to use often, one of my favorites is filter. By applying hue-rotate to the filter property (usually combined with animation/keyframe), I am able to achieve some very cool color effects without specifying each color, but rather letting the hue-rotate to specify the color for me on the color wheel. 

## Optimizations

If I have enough time, I would love to expand some of these projects further and put them into use. So far, a lot of them are more of a standalone feature that hopefully I will be able to incorporate them into a bigger application that I build.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned the success of a project is not detemrined by its triviality.
